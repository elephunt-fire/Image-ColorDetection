# 🎨 Image Color Detector App using Tkinter, Pillow & ColorThief

This project is a **Python desktop application** that detects the **dominant color of an image** and displays its **RGB** and **HEX** values. The application features a simple GUI built with **Tkinter** and leverages the **ColorThief** algorithm for precise color extraction. Additionally, **Pillow (PIL)** is used for image rendering and manipulation.

## 🖼️ Project Overview

* Built using **Python's Tkinter** for GUI.
* Detects the **most dominant color** from any uploaded image.
* Displays the color as a block with **RGB** and **HEX code** values.
* Uses **Pillow** for image handling and **ColorThief** for dominant color detection.
* Developed using **PyCharm IDE**.

---

## ✨ Features

* Upload image files (PNG, JPG, JPEG).
* Extract and display the dominant color visually.
* Show RGB and HEX values of the dominant color.
* Simple and lightweight Tkinter-based GUI.

## 🛠️ Installation Guide

### 1. Setup Python Environment in PyCharm

* Open **PyCharm IDE**.
* Create a **new Python project** or open an existing one.
* Ensure the project has a **virtual environment** activated.

### 2. Install Required Python Packages

Open **Terminal** in PyCharm and execute the following commands:

```bash
pip install pillow
pip install colorthief
```

### 4. Run the Application

Navigate to the project folder and run:

```bash
python App1.py
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Image Upload**: The user selects an image file using the Tkinter file dialog.
2. **Color Detection**: The app processes the image using **ColorThief** to extract the dominant color.
3. **Display Results**:

   * A color block will be displayed with the detected color.
   * RGB and HEX values will be shown below the color block.
4. **Test Assets**: You can use sample images stored inside the **assets/** folder.
